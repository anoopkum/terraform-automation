Step-by-Step Implementation
𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗧𝗲𝗿𝗿𝗮𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺 𝗔𝗜 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀?
With just three simple clicks, you can generate and deploy fully validated Terraform infrastructure in Azure.

🔹 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟭: 𝗘𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗿𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁
 No more writing Terraform code manually!
 ✅ Simply enter your infrastructure request in the User prompt.
 ✅ Example: "Create a resource group named aiagent-terraform-rg in uksouth."
 ✅ AI instantly generates Terraform code and checks existing infrastructure to avoid duplicate resources
✅ Supports custom modules & templates to meet compliance needs and eliminate AI hallucinations (incorrect code).

🔹 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟮: 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲 & 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼-𝗙𝗶𝘅 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲
Before deployment, the AI ensures the code is error-free and follows Terraform best practices:
 ✅ Runs terraform fmt to format the code.
 ✅ Uses terraform validate to check syntax correctness.
 ✅ Applies TFLint to detect security misconfigurations.
 ✅ If errors are found, AI auto-fixes them to ensure compliance

🔹 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟯: 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆 𝘃𝗶𝗮 𝗚𝗶𝘁𝗛𝘂𝗯 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀
Now comes the magic of full automation!
✅ Click "Save & Deploy", and the verified Terraform code is automatically pushed to GitHub.
✅ This triggers GitHub Actions, which runs:
🔹 terraform init 
🔹 terraform validate 
🔹 terraform plan 
🔹 terraform apply

🌍 Once the apply is complete:
✅ The requested infrastructure is deployed in Azure.
✅ The Terraform state is securely stored in Azure Blob Storage.
